# CS 1440 Assignment 4.1: Software Development Plan

## Phase 0: Requirements Analysis (tag name `4.1-analyzed`)
*(20% of your effort)*

**Important - do not change the code in this phase**

Deliver:

*   [ ] Re-write the instructions in your own words.
    *   If you don't do this, you won't know what you're supposed to do!
    *   Don't leave out details!
*   [ ] Explain the problem this program aims to solve.
    *   Describe what a *good* solution looks like.
    *   List what you already know how to do.
    *   Point out any challenges that you can foresee.
*   [ ] List all of the data that is used by the program, making note of where it comes from.
    *   Explain what form the output will take.
*   [ ] List the algorithms that will be used (but don't write them yet).
*   [ ] **Tag** the last commit in this phase `4.1-analyzed` and push it to GitLab.
    *   *Grace Points: if this tag is pushed before class on the Monday before the due date, you will receive up to 5 points back*

The purpose of this stretch of the assingment is to take the already working code and use design 
patterns to evolve the program into an object-oriented program. It needs to have the same basic funcion
as before, but with some change and flexibility.

There will not be any instructions printed to the console if the user inputs something wrong, instead
the Manual will need to be specific on what the user can do, and how to do it. The only things the
program will print to the console will be the status bar (updated) and error messages (FileNotFoundError, 
NotImplementedError).

The users input must specify a direct path to what files they want to use, nothing about file paths
is written into the program. There must also be a default setting the the user runs the program without
specifying the fractal or palette to be used. Ill probalby just use mandelbrot unless I can find anything
better.

### Palette stuff

There is a abstract class Palette that is used to create varios other classes. Either by hardcoding
or using pythons colour module, each class needs to make a new palette that will be used by the program.
These classes must be interchangable, and probably look good as well.

The PaletteFactory is where the actual palette is created. It needs to have a default palette in 
for when the user doesnt specify what palette they want. The default can be any palette from the
classes that have been created.

### Image painter

This stays similar to what is was in the last phase. It is the only place where tkinter is used. 
It takes the products from FractalFactory, PalletteFactory and Fractal Parser (products, not the
actual factories). It needs to take all the information and draw the image.

### Fractal Classes

One Fractal abstract class and four concrete subclasses. The subclasses are interchagable in the 
program, and have to have the count() method inherited from Fractal. These subclasses are the formula
for the fractals (pheonix and mandelbrot). There needs to be at least 2 more different ones, and 
info for that is in the requirments page.

# FractalParser

This part of the program takes information from .frac files and turns them into usable infromation
for the factories. It should process the file onle line at at time, converting it to lowercase, split
the lines by a ":" and store the info into a dictionary with a key:value. It needs to check if 
the file actually gave the right stuff. There can be any amout of empty space around the ":", there might
be wrong data types, ect. But there must be the following: type centerX centerY axisLength pixels iterations
and possibly some optional ones.

Everything must be spelled correctly and give usable info in order for it to work. If something is 
wrong the program will raise an error accordingly

 
## Phase 1: Design (tag name `4.1-designed`)
*(30% of your effort)*

**Important - do not change the code in this phase**

Deliver:

*   [ ] Function signatures that include:
    *   Descriptive names.
    *   Parameter lists.
    *   Documentation strings that explain its purpose and types of inputs and outputs.
*   [ ] Pseudocode that captures how each function works.
    *   Pseudocode != source code.  Do not paste your finished source code into this part of the plan.
*   Explain what happens in the face of good and bad input.
    *   Write a few specific examples that occur to you, and use them later when testing.
*   [ ] **Tag** the last commit in this phase `4.1-designed` and push it to GitLab.
    *   *Grace Points: if this tag is pushed before class on the Monday before the due date, you will receive up to 5 points back*

#### Palette (abstract then subclasses)

-   [ ] Create Abstract Palette class
    -	define getColor an raise NotImplementedError to force subclasses to overwrite 

-   [ ] Create paletteSub1 (name to be decided) that takes a itteration length
    -	This one will be similar to the example given in class, Red -> Black -> Blue -> Black -> ETC.
    -	Divide the itteration count by number of different colors
    -	Round that answer up so that the palette will have the same or more items as the requested itteration
    -	Use that number as the range between the colors.
    - 	Add everything in order to a list and return it.

-   [ ] Create paletteSub2 (name tbd) that takes an itteration length
    -	Create 2 ranges (maybe red -> orange and blue -> green)
    -	Take turns adding to a list, This might give a weird contrast but it shouldnt have a big problem with large itterations.

#### PaletteFactory (implemented as a module)

-   [ ]	makePalette(itterationCount, name = "default") - the default is tbd
    -	if name is not one of the palette subclasses, then NotImplementedError
    -	Else, create the palette specified by name
    -	Return the created palette.

#### Fractal (abstract and subclasses

-   [ ]	Create Abstract Fractal Class
    -	define count() method that raises NotImplementedError so subclasses are forced to override.
    -	define any other methods if I find a need.

-   [ ] Use existing mandelbrot and phoenix algorithms to create fractal subclasses

-   [ ] Mandelbrot3
    -	Same basic function as mandelbrot, but raising the complex number by a power of 3

-   [ ]	BurningShip? (complex, itterationCount)
    -	z = 0j
    -	for the range of itteration count
    -   z = abs(z.real) + abs(z.imag)*1j + c

#### FractalFactoruy (implemented as module)

-	Import all concrete fractal classes

-   [ ] makeFractal(fractalInfo = "default")
    -	if fracType is one of the implimented fractals, pass fractalInfo into correct fractal class and return
    -	(repeat for each fractal class)
    -	else: the requested fractal does not exist, so raise NotImplemented Error

-   [ ] "default = {dict containing hardcoded burningship information cause that looks cool}

#### FractalParser (implemented as module)

-   [ ] getFractalInfo(filePath)
    -	create blank dictionary
    -	open file from .frac file
    -	for line in file:
    -	if blankLine or is a comment (starts with '#') then skip line
    -	line to lowercase
    -	try to split line by ':' and strip any extra blank space
    -	first part is key, second is value and add it to dictionary
    -	except RuntimeError if it cant process the data
    -	testFractalInfo(dictionary)
    - 	close file
    -	return dictionary

-   [ ]	testFractalInfo(dict)
    - 	All fractals need: `type`,`centerX`, `centerY`, `axisLength`, `pixels`, `iterations`
    -	check fractal type, if unrecognized, raise notImplementedError
    - 	If any required info is missing, raise RuntimeError
    -	if any of the values are wrong data type (int instead of float

-   [ ] safe_convert(obj, newType)
    -	as implemented in instructions

#### ImagePainter Class

-   [ ] __init__(info from factories and parser)

-   [ ] statusbar()
    -	as already implemented in first stretch of project

-   [ ] paint() 
    -	same basic implementetion that exits, but treat every fractal as if it were the same
    -	fractalType.count()

#### Main.py
-	import sys, factoryies, parser, and pathlib.Path(?)
-	if no extra arguments in sys.argv, create the default fractal using the default palette
-	if one argument, that is fractal file path (use default palette)
-	if 2 arguments, first is fractal file path, second is palette
-	ignore any additional arguments
-	parse fractalInfo
-	fractalFactory
-	paletteFactory
-	Create object imagePainter( takes the parser and factory products)
-	imagePainer.paint()

## Phase 2: Implementation (tag name `4.1-implemented`)
*(15% of your effort)*

**Finally, you can write code!**

Deliver:

*   [ ] More or less working code.
*   [ ] Note any relevant and interesting events that happened while you wrote the code.
    *   e.g. things you learned, things that didn't go according to plan.
*   [ ] **Tag** the last commit in this phase `4.1-implemented` and push it to GitLab.

### Notes:

-   [ ] Python classes are strange
    -	I asked Chatgpt the difference between python and java classes and how to set up a python class correctly
    -	Turns out the only big difference relevant to me now is `__init__` in python

## Phase 3: Testing and Debugging (tag name `4.1-tested`)
*(30% of your effort)*

Deliver:

*   [ ] A set of test cases that you have personally run on your computer.
    *   Include a description of what happened for each test case.
    *   For any bugs discovered, describe their cause and remedy.
    *   Write your test cases in plain language such that a non-coder could run them and replicate your experience.
*   [ ] **Tag** the last commit in this phase `4.1-tested` and push it to GitLab.


## Phase 4: Deployment (tag name `4.1-deployed`)
*(5% of your effort)*

Deliver:

*   [ ] **Tag** the last commit in this phase `4.1-deployed` and push it to GitLab.
*   [ ] Your repository is pushed to GitLab.
*   [ ] **Verify** that your final commit was received by browsing to its project page on GitLab.
    *   Ensure the project's URL is correct.
    *   Look for all of the tags in the **Tags** tab.
    *   Review the project to ensure that all required files are present and in correct locations.
    *   Check that unwanted files have not been included.
    *   Make any final touches to documentation, including the Sprint Signature and this Plan.
*   [ ] **Validate** that your submission is complete and correct by cloning it to a new location on your computer and re-running it.
	*	Run your program from the command line so you can see how it will behave when your grader runs it.  **Running it in PyCharm is not good enough!**
    *   Run through your test cases to avoid nasty surprises.
    *   Check that your documentation files are all present.


## Phase 5: Maintenance

Spend a few minutes writing thoughtful answers to these questions.  They are meant to make you think about the long-term consequences of choices you made in this project.

Deliver:

*   [ ] Write brief and honest answers to these questions:
    *   What parts of your program are sloppily written and hard to understand?
        *   Are there parts of your program which you aren't quite sure how/why they work?
        *   If a bug is reported in a few months, how long would it take you to find the cause?
    *   Will your documentation make sense to...
        *   ...anybody besides yourself?
        *   ...yourself in six month's time?
    *   How easy will it be to add a new feature to this program in a year?
    *   Will your program continue to work after upgrading...
        *   ...your computer's hardware?
        *   ...the operating system?
        *   ...to the next version of Python?
*   [ ] Make one final commit and push your **completed** Software Development Plan to GitLab.
*   [ ] Respond to the **Assignment Reflection Survey** on Canvas.
